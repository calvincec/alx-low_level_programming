<h1> Low Level Programmimg (c) </h1>

These projects contains code solutions and responses to projects asigned at alx training program<br>
They are mainly for c language(low level programming language)<br>
They help me sharpen my coding skills. I have customised the README's to help me observe the following concepts while learning:
- The major concepts needed to learn in that in that topic
- DSA approaches in solving the problems
- The code organisation/stucture, ie betty

In the entire project, by mentioning DSA I mean using problem solving techniques in comming up with better algorithms hence optimised code. The repo will only feature the optimised codes. It is according to my view and experience

The following are major concepts explored in each folder

## 0x00-hello_world
Using common gcc flags especially the onces used to track compilation process, ```man gcc``` <br>
Using a bash variable to store/execute the above commands <br>
Write simple c codes that implement puts and printf functions <br>
There is no complex DSA knowledge used <br>

## 0x01-variables_if_else_while
Using c variables <br>
If control structure <br>
Operators(logical, arithmetic and Relational) in c and the while loop <br>
Using the ascii table, ```man ascii``` ie to explore the decimal notation of characters <br>
Notable DSA used here includes
- getting last digit of a given number
- Printing all possible combinations of one, two or three digit numbers using while loop

## 0x02-functions_nested_loops
Declaring and calling functions in c  <br>
Using functions prototypes ie, making one or many personalised functions in separate files. adding each function's prototype in main.h. importing main.h in other codes to use the personalised functions  <br>
Still uses ASCII table to check whether the given input is albhabetic or lower case  <br>
Notable DSA used here includes
- Printing multiplication table ie
  ```

  ```

  ```
- A program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
- A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
- Other advanced Fibonacci problems

## 0x03-debugging
More on identifying and removing bugs in a code
Notable DSA is 
- A program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
Declaring and calling functions in c  <br>
Using functions prototypes ie, making one or many personalised functions in separate files. adding each function's prototype in main.h. importing main.h in other codes to use the personalised functions  <br>
It is like task 0X02 But excusively explores the above concept <br>
No complex DSA<br>

## 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
